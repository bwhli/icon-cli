# icon-cli

icon-cli is a command line interface for interacting with the ICON blockchain network. At this time, icon-cli is in active development, so I don't recommend using it for production tasks for now.

Contrary to popular belief, icon-cli is not a [T-Bears](https://github.com/icon-project/t-bears) clone, and has a wide array of features such as:

- Querying general blockchain data.
- Sending transactions, including bulk transactions.
- Querying and voting on CPS proposals.
- Balanced-related tools for liquidating, swapping, and managing loans.
- Keystore management with built-in support for multiple identities.
- And much, much more.

## Commands

TBD - Commands are still changing frequently, and will be documented following the initial feature freeze.
